# Product Requirements Document: Collaborative Music Workspace

Connecting musicians and empowering their creativity.

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a collaborative music
workspace application. The application aims to provide musicians with
a platform to create, share, and refine musical ideas in real-time,
regardless of their physical location.


## 2. Goals

* Enable real-time musical collaboration between two users.

* Provide tools for sharing and developing musical ideas, including
    lyrics, chords, and audio recordings.

* Offer high-quality audio transmission for remote collaboration and
    songwriting sessions.

* Maintain a user-friendly and intuitive interface.

## 3. Target Audience

* Musicians (instrumentalists, vocalists, songwriters, composers).

* Music educators and students.

* Songwriting partners.

* Music producers

## 4. Features

### 4.1 Core Features

* **Peer-to-Peer Audio Connection:**

    * Establish and maintain low-latency audio connections with no noise
    reduction, compression, or other effects that are ineffective for
    music collaboration.
    
    * Support selection of audio input and output devices.
    
    * Provide individual gain control for monitoring and controlling outgoing
        and incoming signals.
    
* **Shared Scratch Pad:**

    * Real-time collaborative text editor.
    
    * Specific formatting options for chords and lyric lines.
        
* **Audio Recording & Sharing:**

    * Ability to record audio snippets locally.

    * Metronome with count-in options
    
    * Audio snippets are immediately shared with other participants
    
    * Playback controls for shared audio.
    
    * Visual representation of audio (e.g. waveform)

    * Simple arrangement of audio with lyrics

    * Shared BPM, measures per line, "tape rate" configuration


### 4.2 Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for Initial Release)

* Instrument tuner.

*   Advanced audio effects processing.

*   Integration with digital audio workstations (DAWs).

*   Video conferencing.

## 5. Technical Requirements

* **Platform:** Web-based application (cross-platform compatibility).

* **Technology Stack:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Web Audio API, WebRTC,
      IndexedDB.

* **Performance:** High quality audio recording and transmission is
    critical. Near immediate synchronization of song edits are
    essential.

* **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle two concurent
    users and sixteen simultaneous audio tracks.

* **Security:** Secure peer-to-peer connection and data transmission.

## 6. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)

* Intuitive layout for audio controls, scratchpad, and recording
    features.

* Clear visual feedback on connection status and audio levels.

* Easy-to-understand controls for recording and playback.

* Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

* Effective zooming to allow precise placement of audio on beat and
  bar lines.

### Push to Talk

When musician 1 starts playback, musician 2 can hear it.  Musician 2
is muted unless they hold a button to talk.  This prevents musician 2
from transmitting their playing back to musician 1.  Musician 1 would
hear this with a significant delay which would make it difficult for
musician 1 to play.  When muted, a musician can record.

## 7. Release Criteria

* All core features implemented and tested.

* Stable and reliable audio connections.

* User-friendly interface with clear instructions.

* Basic error handling and informative messages.

## 8. Future Considerations

* Monetization strategy (e.g., subscription, premium features).

* Community features (e.g., public jam sessions, user profiles).

* Mobile application development.
